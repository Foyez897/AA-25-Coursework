To install face_recognition, simply use 'pip install face_recognition' in a terminal
However, often you may meet an error about the 'dlib' library with cmake.
The easy solution is to visit https://github.com/z-mahmud22/Dlib_Windows_Python3.x and download the 
compiled wheels locally with the python version, and install it from local

if you want to show the found image with the known face, you need opencv and also uncomment the related code.
